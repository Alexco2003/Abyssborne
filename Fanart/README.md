# **Abyssborne Fanart**

I want to give a huge shoutout to my cousin for creating this incredible fanart for **Abyssborne** after playing the game. My cousin is a very talented young artist, and I couldn’t be more grateful for this amazing piece of art! 

It perfectly captures the dark and mysterious essence of the game, and I’m honored to include it in the official repository as a token of my appreciation.

Thank you so much, Vlad Pescariu!
